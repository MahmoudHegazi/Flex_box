# Flex_box
flex box, library or store 


# Properties that control alignment
The properties we will look at in this guide are as follows.

*  justify-content — controls alignment of all items on the main axis.
*  align-items — controls alignment of all items on the cross axis.
*  align-self — controls alignment of an individual flex item on the cross axis. (Used on child)
*  align-content — described in the spec as for “packing flex lines”; controls space between flex lines on the cross axis.

###### <code>box>*:first-child</code> Used to select the first Child
###### <code>box>*:last-child</code> Used to select the last Child.

align-items work with the container 
justify-content work with the nested child  (it has space-between and space around)
